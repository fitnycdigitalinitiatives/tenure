# Introduction

> Thank you for visiting my Tenure & Promotion Portfolio. This portfolio has been compiled as part of my application for Tenure to the Fashion Institute of Technology for the Spring 2021 semester. I am very excited and grateful for the opportunity to share with my colleagues, members of the T&P Committee, and the Administration the contributions I’ve made during my time at FIT—a complete documentation of which you will find below.

I joined the Gladys Marcus Library as the Digital Initiatives Librarian as an adjunct in May 2015. After obtaining CCE in 2018, I was asked to consider applying for this role in a full-time capacity.  My full-time appointment began in November 2018. I was quite fortunate to move into this full-time role, where many of the ideas and seeds of projects developed as an adjunct were able to come to fruition with more time and resources to commit to them.

In my role as the Digital Initiatives Librarian, I am responsible for overseeing and directing library initiatives involving both digital content and metadata. Working from professional standards and best practices, I am responsible for formulating policies and procedures for all parts of the digital content lifecycle: production, management, description, access and preservation. In fulfilling these responsibilities, I have successfully undertaken and managed numerous digital projects, transforming the library into an innovative digital hub at FIT.

In addition to my primary responsibilities, as a faculty member I serve on various teams, committees, and working groups throughout the Library and College. In this capacity, I have made valuable contributions to governance and strategic planning. This essential work with colleagues across the Library and College is very rewarding, and has led to cross-disciplinary digital initiatives that benefit FIT and the greater community. Finally, as a library professional, I am an active member of my field. I attend numerous conferences and workshops, while keeping up-to-date on the relevant topics in my field, contributing to forums and developing open source code.

Thank you for your consideration. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or comments about the work and projects discussed below.
