# Digital Projects

> In my primary function as the Digital Initiatives Librarian, I have undertaken numerous digital projects with the objective of delivering FIT Library resources in new ways to the FIT community, as well as to reach new audiences beyond traditional boundaries.

An additional and necessary aim of these projects is to organize, manage and preserve our growing array of digital content. As the Library continues to evolve into the 21st century, an increasing amount of digital content is being created by the Library and the College, itself, rather than collected primarily from third parties. Integral in the creation of new digital content is the responsibility to steward it to future generations. Along with overseeing the practical aspects of this digital content lifecycle, I have also sought to create websites and user interfaces that reflect the creativity of the FIT brand and provide users with novel ways of discovering content. These sites not only showcase unique, exciting content, but FIT itself.

To develop these projects, I have collaborated with colleagues across the Library and the College. I have worked closely FIT Information Technology (IT) to set up servers to host and maintain these projects. I have worked with a variety of open-source applications and numerous coding languages, which has created less reliance on costly third-party hosting. When working with teams, I have utilized project management tools to create more efficient workflows and accountability. Throughout, a growing web presence has been built for the Library and the College, and with each new project proof that we can continue to grow further.

## SPARC Digital [sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu](https://sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu/)

> "SPARC Digital is a platform created by the FIT Library's Special Collections & College Archives to showcase the rare and unique materials from our collections that have been digitized. Our goal is to make our collections more widely available online to the FIT community and the general public."

Background: Prior to the launch of SPARC Digital in 2017, the FIT Library's Special Collections & College Archives (SPARC) did not have a dedicated platform for its digitized materials. A small portion of their digitized images (over 2000 images of original fashion sketches and photographs) had been uploaded to FITDIL, the library's general purpose digital image library. FITDIL, however, is primarily intended for usage within the FIT community, and its general nature limits its ability to showcase the uniqueness of SPARC's materials.

SPARC Digital was thus conceived as a platform that would not only showcase digitized materials, but also allow us to tell the stories of these materials through online exhibitions. In addition, we wanted to offer users the ability to navigate these collections by [color](https://sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu/about#color-search), which is a feature that is being seen more and more in online collections. When a user views an image on SPARC Digital, they will see a series of [swatches]({{ '/assets/images/color-palette.jpg' | relative_url }}) that indicate the predominant colors that make up that image, and by clicking on one of those color swatches, the site will return all the [images]({{ '/assets/images/color-browse.jpg' | relative_url }}) that share that color. Finally, we wanted to design a site and user experience that reflected the elegant aesthetics of the materials, as well as to contribute positively to the public face of FIT.

- Since launching in 2017, the collection has grown from 2,500 to nearly 7,500 images, with additional 3 online exhibitions added
  - Led team to add over 4,000 images from the [André Studios collection](https://sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu/items/browse?collection=28), previously digitized and hosted by the NYPL, utilizing Airtable, the cloud database platform, to facilitate workflow and new metadata creation
- Working with FIT IT, upgraded servers hosting SPARC Digital from Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6 to 7, including underlying application dependencies PHP and MySQL
- Made site compliant with [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) framework/standards
- Site statistics: 13,884 unique visitors with 156,281 total pageviews (7.84 pages/sessions)

### SPARC Digital Exhibition <br/> Max Meyer and A. Beller & Co. <br/> Interpreting a Hidden History of NYC's Garment District [sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu/exhibits/show/meyer-beller](https://sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu/exhibits/show/meyer-beller)

[![Max Meyer and A. Beller & Co. exhibition landing page]({{ '/assets/images/max-meyer.png' | relative_url }})](https://sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu/exhibits/show/meyer-beller)

Background: This long-brewing project focusing on FIT founder, Max Meyer, was originally intended to be mounted in the Art and Design Gallery. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, it was reconsidered as an online exhibition and I was brought on to act as the Digital Exhibition Designer. The final product, launched in early-2021, was a collaboration between FIT Library’s Special Collections and College Archives (led by Prof. Karen Trivette), the Fashion and Textile Studies graduate program, the Visual Presentation and Exhibition Design department, and the Art & Design Gallery.

For this particular online exhibition, an entirely new exhibition template and design was created for SPARC Digital, the goal being to make this exhibition feel special because it had been intended to be something of a large-scale, physically-mounted exhibition (and was also originally conceived to commemorate the 75th anniversary of FIT). The design used a great deal of animation, utilizing javascript not previously used in Library digital initiatives, as well as augmented reality (see the FITting Room below), panel discussions and podcasts. It was truly a multimedia experience.

## Archive on Demand [archiveondemand.fitnyc.edu](https://archiveondemand.fitnyc.edu/)

[![Archive on Demand Homepage]({{ '/assets/images/archiveOnDemand.png' | relative_url }})](https://archiveondemand.fitnyc.edu/)

> "Archive on Demand is an online video platform created by the FIT Library. We provide the FIT community and the general public with videos of lectures and events that occur on campus. This online video resource is a wonderful way to increase access to some of the lectures, events, exhibitions, and instruction happening at FIT and share them with a wider audience."

Background: FIT holds numerous lectures, events and exhibitions that have been recorded over the years, and in practice these videos are shared with the FIT Community and general public through various YouTube channels held by departments across the College. The idea behind Archive on Demand is to curate and aggregate these videos onto a single platform. Along with being a single point of access for users, Archive on Demand also serves as a means of organizing, describing, and preserving the College's video assets. In addition, with Archive on Demand as point of distribution, the site has been instrumental in reshaping and improving video workflows on campus.

- Since launching in 2017, the Archive on Demand collection has more than tripled in size, now totaling 686 videos
- Developed project to digitize video from the [*Faces and Places in Fashion*](https://archiveondemand.fitnyc.edu/items/browse?search=&advanced%5B0%5D%5Belement_id%5D=70&advanced%5B0%5D%5Bterms%5D=Faces+and+Places+in+Fashion&advanced%5B0%5D%5Btype%5D=is+exactly) series by ‘ripping’ DVD copy and making available online through Archive on Demand
- Developed e-sign process for participant release forms for videos of FIT events, using Adobe Sign
- Site statistics: 16,106 unique visitors with 42,910 total pageviews (2.12 pages/sessions)

### Archive on Demand Video Captioning Project

![Captioning interface]({{ '/assets/images/captions1.png' | relative_url }})

Background: As stipulated in SUNY-wide and federal guidelines, all videos posted online by academic institutions must be properly captioned for accessibility purposes. During the beginning stages of the remote work period due the pandemic, a project was conceived for library employees that normally worked in public-facing roles to work on captioning videos.

- Created workflows, standards, and documentation
- Trained team of 12 on captioning workflow
- Team captioned both a backlog of videos and videos on-demand for departments across the College

## The FITting Room [fittingroom.fitnyc.edu](https://fittingroom.fitnyc.edu/)

[![The FITting Room Homepage]({{ '/assets/images/fittingRoom.jpg' | relative_url }})](https://fittingroom.fitnyc.edu/)

> The FITting Room is an augmented reality (AR) experience that allows users to 'try on' rare and unique materials from the FIT Library’s Special Collections and College Archives (SPARC). Built using the ZapWorks Studio platform, this AR experience brings historic source material to life. Users can try on accessories—hats, scarves, earrings—featured in original fashion sketches by legendary artists.

Background: This project was first conceived after learning about AR and the [ZapWorks Studio platform](https://zap.works/studio/) from the [FIT Faculty Research Space](https://www.fitnyc.edu/frs/). Working with Reference Librarian, Professor Miyo Sandlin, the project lead, we planned an AR poster campaign throughout the College. The idea was to print high-resolution posters of fashion sketches with QR codes that would trigger an AR experience allowing users to try on an article of clothing from the sketch. This would typically be a hat because the Zappar platform used face tracking technology, so it needed to be an article of clothing that could be 'attached' on the head or neck, as opposed to something like gloves (because the technology doesn't recognize hands). Creating the AR experience required carefully cropping the sketches using Photoshop, which were then locked into the Zappar experience. As we began building a collection of sketches/experiences and planned our marketing and rollout of the project, it would need to be re-envisioned due to FIT's migration to a remote-learning environment.

AR is typically associated with mobile phones. The user typically scans a QR code with the camera on their phone and the experience is triggered. However, a few weeks into the remote-work environment we realized how important webcams had suddenly become, and realized that our AR experience didn't necessarily need to be limited to mobile phones. We reconceived the project as a website where users could visit and trigger the AR experience directly from their desktop or laptop computer (and the phone would still work too). A website was quickly spun up using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and lauched in April 2020.

- Designed the FITting Room platform/website
- Featured in Zappar blog, "[Month in AR - August 2020](https://www.zappar.com/blog/month-ar-august-2020/)," and on FIT Newsroom, "[Five Amazing Things in FIT’s Library—Available Everywhere](https://news.fitnyc.edu/2020/05/07/five-amazing-things-in-fits-library-available-everywhere/)"
- Article co-authored with Prof. Miyo Sandlin, “Fashion for All,” accepted for publication in Jan./Feb. 2021 issue of [*Online Searcher*](https://www.infotoday.com/onlinesearcher/)
- Site statistics: 764 unique visitors with 1,613 total pageviews

## FIT Digital Repository / Archivematica
**\*In development**

![Digital Repository Architecture Flowchart]({{ '/assets/images/archivematica.png' | relative_url }})

Background: Upon receiving a full-time appointment, one of my primary goals was to rebuild the Library's digital infrastructure on firmer standing. Digital assets are currently being managed across a series of disconnected systems with very few mechanisms to ensure long-term preservation. The goal then was to build a system where all digital assets could be centrally managed, responsibly secured and preserved, and distributed to endusers without sacrificing any of the functionality currently employed. This 'FIT Digital Repository' (name pending) will be built using [Archivematica](https://www.archivematica.org/en/) to process assets for long-term preservation in a cloud-based storage environment and [Omeka-S](https://omeka.org/s/) to manage and distribute them.

- Installed Archivematica and Omeka-S instances on FIT servers
- Successfully completed pilot project using [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) cloud storage and [Cantaloupe](https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/) image server for processing large, high-resolution images
- Wrote Archivematica automation [script](https://github.com/fitnycdigitalinitiatives/automation-tools/blob/master/dips/omeka_upload.py) for deposit of access copies and metadata into Omeka-S application
- Contributed [code](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica-storage-service/pull/515) to official Archivematica repository for Storage Service version 0.16
- Developed Omeka-S [module](https://github.com/fitnycdigitalinitiatives/FITModule) for integrating Omeka-S with Archivematica and cloud-based storage infrastructure

## Archaic Bannerstone Project [bannerstone.fitnyc.edu](https://bannerstone.fitnyc.edu/)

[![Archaic Bannerstone Project Homepage]({{ '/assets/images/archaicBannerstoneProject.png' | relative_url }})](https://bannerstone.fitnyc.edu/)

> "The Archaic Bannerstone Project is a resource for the study of the aesthetically complex, anomalous ancient Native American lithics known as bannerstones."

Background: The Archaic Bannerstone Project is the brainchild of Professor [Anna Blume](http://www.fitnyc.edu/art-history/faculty/anna-blume.php) of the History of Art Dept., focusing on her archaeological research into bannerstones. Developed using a combination of the Omeka platform and Github Pages, this site offers users the ability view images of bannerstones at high resolution and multiple angles, and includes detailed metadata. The site also includes digital essay by Prof. Blume, "Recommendation for the Photographing of Bannerstones," developed specifically for the site, as well as other papers on bannerstones by members of the archaeological community.

- After launching the site in November 2018, an additional 32 bannerstones from the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution have been added to the collection, as well as several essays
- Featured on [FIT Newsroom](https://news.fitnyc.edu/2019/01/28/bannerstone/)
- Site statistics: 3,399 unique users with 18,330 total pageviews

## FIT 75th Anniversary Timeline [timeline.fitnyc.edu](https://timeline.fitnyc.edu/)

[![Anniversary Timeline Homepage]({{ '/assets/images/anniversaryTimeline.png' | relative_url }})](https://timeline.fitnyc.edu/)

Background: There were several ideas for projects being developed to commemorate the 75th anniversary of FIT—this timeline ultimately being a combination of several projects and a collaboration between the Library and Communications and External Relations (CER). The branding work for the 75th was [developed](https://news.fitnyc.edu/2020/02/03/75th_logo_design/) by faculty and students from Advertising and Digital Design, which the design of this website drew heavily on. Images were sourced from the College Archives.

- Developed custom Wordpress theme
- Site implemented parallax and smooth scrolling
- [Presented](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_Il4EmPet1AKJHL6_5FTIDTIVfWZn44hmfG-lVz_jgc/edit?usp=sharing) on this project/collaboration and Exhibitions Timeline (see below) at FIT Academic Open Mic, March 9, 2020

## Exhibitions Timeline [exhibitions.fitnyc.edu/exhibitions-timeline](https://exhibitions.fitnyc.edu/exhibitions-timeline/)
**\*Pending launch**

[![Exhibitions Timeline]({{ '/assets/images/exhibitionsTimeline.png' | relative_url }})](https://exhibitions.fitnyc.edu/exhibitions-timeline/)

Background: Simultaneous to the 75th anniversary of the College was the 50th anniversary of the [Museum at FIT](http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/exhibitionism.php). Very much designed as complement to the 75th anniversary site—this flows horizontally whereas the 75th flows vertically—this site is also intended not just to commemorate the 50th anniversary but also to serve as an ongoing catalog of every exhibition the Museum has mounted. A collaboration with the Museum's digital media team.

- Developed custom Wordpress theme
- Site implements [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) customized to work with timeline range slider
- Built generic, open-source [Timeline](https://github.com/fitnycdigitalinitiatives/timeline) template using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [MiniComp](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/)

## FIT Authors [authors.fitnyc.edu](https://authors.fitnyc.edu/)

[![FIT Authors Homepage]({{ '/assets/images/fitAuthors.png' | relative_url }})](https://authors.fitnyc.edu/)

> "FIT Authors is an initiative of the FIT Library to showcase the scholarship and creativity of the FIT community, as well as to promote our collections. Each semester, the Library collects submissions from authors within the FIT community (faculty, staff, and alumni) to create informative profiles. The Library features these authors and their works in a rotating display, and hosts an FIT Authors event several times a semester. On this site, you can find profiles of FIT authors, a showcasing of associated events, as well as a listing of all recently published books by FIT authors."

Background: The FIT Authors program was originally created by the FIT Senate Library Committee, but was later handed off to the Library where the website was developed, along additional programing details. The website includes author profiles, a listing of events and published works, and an online questionnaire for potential new authors.

- Developed website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [MiniComp](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/)
- First digital initiative to be hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Assisted in the transferring of the FIT Authors program from direction under the Faculty Senate Library Committee to the Library directly; developed forms and procedures for maintaining the program
- Site statistics: 1,366 unique users with 5,497 total pageviews

## Teaching Business and Labor History to Art and Design Students [businesshistory.fitnyc.edu](https://businesshistory.fitnyc.edu/)

[![Teaching Business and Labor History to Art and Design Students Homepage]({{ '/assets/images/businessLabor.png' | relative_url }})](https://businesshistory.fitnyc.edu/)

> "*Teaching Business and Labor History to Art and Design Students* [is] an NEH-funded project to create curriculum for art and design students in order to educate them on the history of working as an artist or designer. On this site, you can find information on the development of this project, as well as a collection of resources, curricular materials and academic studies developed for this project."

Background: This is the project site for NEH-funded project that involves seminars, symposiums, and the development of curriculum. It is led by Professor Kyunghee Pyun (History of Art) and Professor Daniel Levinson-Wilk (American History).

- Joined project as web designer, interfacing with FIT IT and CER to setup site on WP Engine
- Developed custom Wordpress theme

## OneSearch New Books Carousel [onesearch.fitnyc.edu](https://onesearch.fitnyc.edu/discovery/search?vid=01SUNY_FIT:01SUNY_FIT)

[![OneSearch Homepage]({{ '/assets/images/newBooks.png' | relative_url }})](https://onesearch.fitnyc.edu/discovery/search?vid=01SUNY_FIT:01SUNY_FIT)

Background: In 2019, as part of a SUNY-wide effort, the Library migrated to a new catalog, *OneSearch*, built on the Alma/Primo library service platform. This new platform gave the Library the ability greater flexibility to customize the catalog homepage. Using a combination of free tools, the new books carousels shows users the latest books added to our collections and is updated automatically on a weekly basis.

- Developed [process](https://github.com/fitnycdigitalinitiatives/onesearch-newbooks) using Alma analytics, Alma API, Python script, Google Books API (for the covers), and Travis CI to automate process for adding new books to carousel

## The Ruth Finley Collection <br/> Digitizing 70 Years of the Fashion Calendar
**\*Currently in application for CLIR grant**

[![Fashion Calendar Map Visualization]({{ '/assets/images/fashionCalendar.png' | relative_url }})](https://fashion-calendar.github.io/map/)

Background: This project, led by Prof. Natalie Nudell of the Art History Dept., focuses on Ruth Finley's *Fashion Calendar*, a weekly publication listing important fashion events. With the entire 70-year run of this publication held in the Library's Special Collections and College Archives, the primary goal of this project is to digitize each issue and make it available online. In addition, because the *Fashion Calendar* is so rich with data (including names, addresses, dates associated with each event), the project seeks to apply various digital humanities tools—mapping visualizations, text analysis, etc.—to create added value for researchers.

- Drafted CLIR Grant application sections, Technical Plan and Digital Preservation/Discoverability Plan
- CLIR Grant application advanced to final round
- Created project demo, including mapping visualization, using [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)

## FIT Institutional Repository
**\*In development**

Background: Students in the School of Graduate Studies create wide variety of qualifying papers or projects as a condition of being granted a degree. The more conventional of these, theses, are processed, collected and managed as part of the ProQuest Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Administrator (ETD), and then published in a ProQuest database. This database, however, is only accessible to users whose institutions subscribe to it. On top of that, many of the qualifying projects—capstone projects, runway shows, etc.—are not able to be captured through the ProQuest ETD. This has created the need for the Library to create and institutional repository, which would collect all qualifying papers/projects by graduate students and make them available open access. As this project develops, it is planned to additionally include any academic output from the FIT community (e.g. faculty research, other student work). Note: this project works in tandem with the above-mentioned *Digital* Repository, but is separate.

- Developed Institutional Repository demo for meeting with Graduate Studies faculty
- Drafted [University Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1McTxbHgyTuGtiKDd9xMmokxDP56z_YCk76IOdtxJV_E/edit?usp=sharing), a release form for students to deposit their works open access in the repository.
