# Digital Projects

> In my primary function as the Digital Initiatives Librarian, I have undertaken numerous digital projects with the objective of delivering FIT Library resources in new ways to the FIT community, as well as to reach new audiences beyond traditional boundaries.

An additional and necessary aim of these projects is to organize, manage and preserve our growing array of digital content. As the Library continues to evolve into the 21st century, an increasing amount of digital content is being created by the Library and the College, itself, rather than collected primarily from third parties. Integral in the creation of new digital content is the responsibility to steward it to future generations. Along with overseeing the practical aspects of this digital content lifecycle, I have also sought to create websites and user interfaces that reflect the creativity of the FIT brand and provide users with novel ways of discovering content. These sites not only showcase unique, exciting content, but FIT itself.

To develop these projects, I have collaborated with colleagues across the Library and the College. I have worked closely FIT Information Technology (IT) to set up servers to host and maintain these projects. I have worked with a variety of open-source applications and numerous coding languages, which has created less reliance on costly third-party hosting. When working with teams, I have utilized project management tools to create more efficient workflows and accountability. Throughout, a growing web presence has been built for the Library and the College, and with each new project proof that we can continue to grow further.

> "SPARC Digital is a platform created by the FIT Library's Special Collections & College Archives to showcase the rare and unique materials from our collections that have been digitized. Our goal is to make our collections more widely available online to the FIT community and the general public."

Background: Prior to the launch of SPARC Digital in 2017, the FIT Library's Special Collections & College Archives (SPARC) did not have a dedicated platform for its digitized materials. A small portion of their digitized images (over 2000 images of original fashion sketches and photographs) had been uploaded to FITDIL, the library's general purpose digital image library. FITDIL, however, is primarily intended for usage within the FIT community, and its general nature limits its ability to showcase the uniqueness of SPARC's materials.

SPARC Digital was thus conceived as a platform that would not only showcase digitized materials, but also allow us to tell the stories of these materials through online exhibitions. In addition, we wanted to offer users the ability to navigate these collections by [color](https://sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu/about#color-search), which is a feature that is being seen more and more in online collections. When a user views an image on SPARC Digital, they will see a series of [swatches]({{ '/assets/images/color-palette.jpg' | relative_url }}) that indicate the predominant colors that make up that image, and by clicking on one of those color swatches, the site will return all the [images]({{ '/assets/images/color-browse.jpg' | relative_url }}) that share that color. Finally, we wanted to design a site and user experience that reflected the elegant aesthetics of the materials, as well as to contribute positively to the public face of FIT.

- Since launching in 2017, the collection has grown from 2,500 to nearly 7,500 images, with additional 3 online exhibitions added
  - Led team to add over 4,000 images from the [André Studios collection](https://sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu/items/browse?collection=28), previously digitized and hosted by the NYPL, utilizing Airtable, the cloud database platform, to facilitate workflow and new metadata creation
- Working with FIT IT, upgraded servers hosting SPARC Digital from Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6 to 7, including underlying application dependencies PHP and MySQL
- Made site compliant with [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) framework/standards
- Site statistics: 13,884 unique visitors with 156,281 total pageviews (7.84 pages/sessions)

### SPARC Digital Exhibition <br/> Max Meyer and A. Beller & Co. <br/> Interpreting a Hidden History of NYC's Garment District [sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu/exhibits/show/meyer-beller](https://sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu/exhibits/show/meyer-beller)

[![Max Meyer and A. Beller & Co. exhibition landing page]({{ '/assets/images/max-meyer.png' | relative_url }})](https://sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu/exhibits/show/meyer-beller)

> This long-brewing project focusing on FIT founder, Max Meyer, was originally intended to be mounted in the Art and Design Gallery. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, it was reconsidered as an online exhibition and I was brought on to act as the Digital Exhibition Designer. The final product, launched in early-2021, was a collaboration between FIT Library’s Special Collections and College Archives (led by Prof. Karen Trivette), the Fashion and Textile Studies graduate program, the Visual Presentation and Exhibition Design department, and the Art & Design Gallery.

For this particular online exhibition, an entirely new exhibition template and design was created for SPARC Digital, the goal being to make this exhibition feel special because it had been intended to be something of a large-scale, physically-mounted exhibition (and was also originally conceived to commemorate the 75th anniversary of FIT). The design used a great deal of animation, utilizing javascript not previously used in Library digital initiatives, as well as augmented reality (see the FITting Room below), panel discussions and podcasts. It was truly a multimedia experience.

## Archive on Demand [archiveondemand.fitnyc.edu](https://archiveondemand.fitnyc.edu/)

[![Archive on Demand Homepage]({{ '/assets/images/archiveOnDemand.png' | relative_url }})](https://archiveondemand.fitnyc.edu/)

> "Archive on Demand is an online video platform created by the FIT Library. We provide the FIT community and the general public with videos of lectures and events that occur on campus. This online video resource is a wonderful way to increase access to some of the lectures, events, exhibitions, and instruction happening at FIT and share them with a wider audience."

Background: FIT holds numerous lectures, events and exhibitions that have been recorded over the years, and in practice these videos are shared with the FIT Community and general public through various YouTube channels held by departments across the College. The idea behind Archive on Demand is to curate and aggregate these videos onto a single platform. Along with being a single point of access for users, Archive on Demand also serves as a means of organizing, describing, and preserving the College's video assets. In addition, with Archive on Demand as point of distribution, the site has been instrumental in reshaping and improving video workflows on campus.

- Since launching in 2017, the Archive on Demand collection has more than tripled in size, now totaling 686 videos
- Developed project to digitize video from the [*Faces and Places in Fashion*](https://archiveondemand.fitnyc.edu/items/browse?search=&advanced%5B0%5D%5Belement_id%5D=70&advanced%5B0%5D%5Bterms%5D=Faces+and+Places+in+Fashion&advanced%5B0%5D%5Btype%5D=is+exactly) series by ‘ripping’ DVD copy and making available online through Archive on Demand
- Site statistics: 16,106 unique visitors with 42,910 total pageviews (2.12 pages/sessions)

### Archive on Demand Video Captioning Project

![Captioning interface]({{ '/assets/images/captions1.png' | relative_url }})

> As stipulated in SUNY-wide and federal guidelines, all videos posted online by academic institutions must be properly captioned for accessibility purposes. During the beginning stages of the remote work period due the pandemic, a project was conceived for library employees that normally worked in public-facing roles to work on captioning videos.

- Created workflows, standards, and documentation
- Trained team of 12 on captioning workflow
- Team captioned both a backlog of videos and videos on-demand for departments across the College

## The FITting Room [fittingroom.fitnyc.edu](https://fittingroom.fitnyc.edu/)

[![The FITting Room Homepage]({{ '/assets/images/fittingRoom.jpg' | relative_url }})](https://fittingroom.fitnyc.edu/)

> The FITting Room is an augmented reality (AR) experience that allows users to 'try on' rare and unique materials from the FIT Library’s Special Collections and College Archives (SPARC). Built using the ZapWorks Studio platform, this AR experience brings historic source material to life. Users can try on accessories—hats, scarves, earrings—featured in original fashion sketches by legendary artists.

Background: This project was first conceived after learning about AR and the [ZapWorks Studio platform](https://zap.works/studio/) from the FIT Faculty Research Space. Working with Reference Librarian, Professor Miyo Sandlin, the project lead, we planned an AR poster campaign throughout the College. The idea was to print high-resolution posters of fashion sketches with QR codes that would trigger an AR experience allowing users to try on an article of clothing from the sketch. This would typically be a hat because the Zappar platform used face tracking technology, so it needed to be an article of clothing that could be 'attached' on the head or neck, as opposed to something like gloves (because the technology doesn't recognize hands). Creating the AR experience required carefully cropping the sketches using Photoshop, which were then locked into the Zappar experience. As we began building a collection of sketches/experiences and planned our marketing and rollout of the project, it would need to be re-envisioned due to FIT's migration to a remote-learning environment.

AR is typically associated with mobile phones. The user typically scans a QR code with the camera on their phone and the experience is triggered. However, a few weeks into the remote-work environment we realized how important webcams had suddenly become, and realized that our AR experience didn't necessarily need to be limited to mobile phones. We reconceived the project as a website where users could visit and trigger the AR experience directly from their desktop or laptop computer (and the phone would still work too). A website was quickly spun up using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and lauched in April 2020.

- Designed the FITting Room platform/website

## Archaic Bannerstone Project [bannerstone.fitnyc.edu](https://bannerstone.fitnyc.edu/)

[![Archaic Bannerstone Project Homepage]({{ '/assets/images/archaicBannerstoneProject.png' | relative_url }})](https://bannerstone.fitnyc.edu/)

> "The Archaic Bannerstone Project is a resource for the study of the aesthetically complex, anomalous ancient Native American lithics known as bannerstones."

Background: The Archaic Bannerstone Project is the brainchild of Professor [Anna Blume](http://www.fitnyc.edu/art-history/faculty/anna-blume.php) of the History of Art Dept., focusing on her archaeological research into bannerstones. Developed using a combination of the Omeka platform and Github Pages, this site offers users the ability view images of bannerstones at high resolution and multiple angles, and includes detailed metadata. The site also includes digital essay by Prof. Blume, "Recommendation for the Photographing of Bannerstones," developed specifically for the site, as well as other papers on bannerstones by members of the archaeological community.

- After launching the site in November 2018, an additional 32 bannerstones from the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution have been added to the collection, as well as several essays
- Featured on [FIT Newsroom](https://news.fitnyc.edu/2019/01/28/bannerstone/)
- Site statistics: 3,399 unique users with 18,330 total pageviews
