# Professional Development

> As a library professional, I take advantage of the many conferences and workshops offered in New York City, as well as many held virtually. Much of this activity has directly influenced my work at FIT. As my body of work continues to develop, I am actively pursuing opportunities for publication and presentations at conferences. In addition, as a member of the online community, I have contributed to my field through code repositories and listservs.

## Open Source Contributions

> In the spirit of Open Source and Open Access, I publish all of the code for the digital projects I have contributed to (including this portfolio) on [GitHub](https://github.com/fitnycdigitalinitiatives). GitHub is a platform that hosts code repositories for millions of users, and facilitates sharing, collaboration, and reuse of Open Source projects. As I have used the code of other developers to bring projects to fruition, so others can do the same with my contributions.
