# Future Goals

> As I compiled this T&P Portfolio, it gave me a chance to reflect on the body of work I have created since moving into a full-time faculty position here at FIT. Looking back, I am quite proud of my work, especially considering that nearly a year of it was created during the tumult and tragedy of the pandemic. In many ways, however, the work that I specialize in, digital initiatives, became more urgent in the last year. The *digital* became less of a replacement, less of a surrogate for something real—in the remote working environment, it became the thing itself.

That said, one of my immediate future goals, though the timing of this is entirely out of my hands, is to return to FIT and begin working with my colleagues again. One of my biggest successes, I believe, since moving from adjunct to full-time here, was the number of new projects I was able to initiate with faculty and staff across the College—most of which were spurred by relationships created in-person. These collaborations, often interdisciplinary and dealing with subject matter that is new to me, are the most exciting and often the most creative. I would like to continue working on projects like these and to continue to position the library as *the* resource for Digital Humanities projects at FIT.

As a matter of practicality, the Digital Repository project (mentioned above) is a pressing matter and also an important, immediate goal. A centrally-managed repository with safe, secure storage of digital assets would have obvious advantages. The migration of digital assets to this new system will take time and much effort. However, it will be worth the effort not only because it will secure our valuable assets and heritage, but because it will also provide an opportunity to rethink and reformulate digital strategies and workflows across the Library. They are inextricably linked: because our current digital infrastructure consists of a series of disconnected systems, it is reflected also in our work. That is, with each siloed system there is a staff in a department doing similar work to another staff in a different department on a different system. There are opportunities to pool these efforts to achieve more. I hope going forward to develop and execute a more unified strategy for working with digital assets in the Library, so that there is more overlap and greater efficiency.

- Further position the Library as a resource for Digital Humanities Projects at the College
- Development/launch of a centralized system for managing and preserving digital assets
- Create a strategy/workflows across departments that complements this system, reducing redundancies and silos
- Improved integration of our digital assets outside the FIT ecosystem: linked data, wikidata, DPLA, etc.
- Actively pursue conference participation and national speaking opportunities
